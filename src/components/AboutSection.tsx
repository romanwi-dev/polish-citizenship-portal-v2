            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              There are more than 20 million people of Polish descent that live outside of Poland today, which itself has a population of about 38.5 million. This means that more than 1/3 of Poles and people of Polish descent actually live outside of the country. For many generations of European unrest, people have been emigrating outside of Poland, especially in the 20th century.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Since 1989, however, the quality of life has changed for the better in Poland. Poland has been an EU member since 2004 and is one of its biggest countries. We support the idea of a united Europe, and being a European citizen is a widely held dream. Many people of Polish origin can now legally confirm their Polish citizenship by descent and obtain the Polish European passport as a gateway to the EU.
