          a1: 'You may be eligible if you have Polish ancestors (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent) who were Polish citizens. The key is proving an unbroken chain of citizenship transmission from your Polish ancestor to you.',
          q2: 'What if my ancestor left before 1920?',
          a2: 'Leaving before 1920 does not automatically make you ineligible. Under the 1920 Citizenship Act, people connected to territories that became Poland could acquire Polish citizenship based on domicile/right of residence.',
          q3: 'Can I apply through my grandmother\'s line?',
          a3: 'Yes, you can claim citizenship through female ancestors, though the rules vary depending on when your ancestor had children. We analyze your specific family timeline to determine the best legal pathway.',
          q4: 'Can I claim through my great-grandparents?',
          a4: 'Yes, many successful cases involve great-grandparents or even earlier generations. The key is proving the unbroken chain of citizenship transmission through each generation.',
          q5: 'Do I need to speak Polish?',

          q2: 'Where do I file if I live outside Poland?',

          q2: 'El nombre de mi ancestro fue cambiado - ¿es eso un problema?',
          a2: 'Los cambios de nombre son comunes y manejables. Ayudamos a establecer la continuidad de identidad a través de documentación como decretos de cambio de nombre, registros de inmigración y evidencia genealógica.',

          q4: '¿Pueden incluirse los niños?',
          a4: 'Sí, una vez que confirme su ciudadanía polaca, sus hijos menores pueden registrarse como ciudadanos polacos. El proceso es sencillo para niños menores de 16 años.',
          q5: '¿Qué pasa con la doble ciudadanía?',
          a5: 'Polonia permite la doble ciudadanía. Confirmar la ciudadanía polaca no requiere renunciar a otras ciudadanías, y la mayoría de los países (incluidos EE. UU., Canadá, Reino Unido) también permiten la doble ciudadanía.'

          a1: 'A confirmação de cidadania polonesa é um processo legal minucioso realizado por governadores provinciais. O cronograma realista é de 1,5 a 4 anos devido à verificação de documentos, pesquisa de registros históricos e atrasos governamentais.',
          q2: 'Onde apresento se moro fora da Polônia?',
          a2: 'As solicitações são apresentadas ao governador provincial apropriado na Polônia. Você não precisa estar na Polônia para apresentar - lidamos com todas as submissões e comunicações em seu nome.',
          q3: 'O que acontece durante a fase governamental?',
          a3: 'Após a apresentação, o Gabinete do Voivoda revisa sua solicitação. Eles podem solicitar evidências adicionais. Respondemos a todas as solicitações governamentais profissionalmente e lidamos com todas as comunicações em polonês.',
          q4: 'O processo pode ser mais rápido?',
          a4: 'Podemos ajudar a acelerar através de documentação adequada, tempo estratégico e representação legal profissional. No entanto, alguma espera é inevitável devido aos tempos de processamento governamental.',
          q5: 'E se eu receber uma decisão negativa?',
          a5: 'Se uma decisão negativa for emitida, podemos apresentar um recurso ou revisão administrativa. Muitos casos são vencidos em recurso com evidências adicionais e argumentos legais mais fortes.'

          q2: 'Existem planos de pagamento disponíveis?',

          q3: 'O que as taxas governamentais incluem?',
          a3: 'As taxas governamentais cobrem o processamento de solicitações, certificação de documentos e carimbos oficiais. Estas são separadas de nossas taxas legais e variam de acordo com o caso.',
          q4: 'Eu pago se meu caso não for bem-sucedido?',
          a4: 'Nossa estrutura de taxas é projetada para ser justa. As taxas de avaliação inicial cobrem a avaliação do caso. As taxas principais estão vinculadas à apresentação e representação bem-sucedidas.',
          q5: 'E quanto aos custos de tradução?',

          q2: 'E se os registros foram destruídos?',
          a2: 'Muitos registros poloneses sobreviveram apesar das guerras. Temos ampla experiência em encontrar evidências alternativas e trabalhar com arquivos em todo o mundo para reconstruir documentação perdida.',
          q3: 'Os documentos precisam ser traduzidos?',

          q2: 'O nome do meu ancestral foi alterado - isso é um problema?',
          a2: 'Mudanças de nome são comuns e gerenciáveis. Ajudamos a estabelecer continuidade de identidade através de documentação como decretos de mudança de nome, registros de imigração e evidências genealógicas.',

          a3: 'Elos faltantes podem ser preenchidos através de pesquisa de arquivo, registros de igreja, documentos de imigração e outras fontes. Nos especializamos em reconstruir histórias familiares.',
          q4: 'As crianças podem ser incluídas?',
          a4: 'Sim, uma vez que você confirme sua cidadania polonesa, seus filhos menores podem ser registrados como cidadãos poloneses. O processo é direto para crianças menores de 16 anos.',
          q5: 'E quanto à dupla cidadania?',
          a5: 'A Polônia permite dupla cidadania. Confirmar a cidadania polonesa não exige renunciar a outras cidadanias, e a maioria dos países (incluindo EUA, Canadá, Reino Unido) também permite dupla cidadania.'

          a1: 'Sie könnten berechtigt sein, wenn Sie polnische Vorfahren (Elternteil, Großelternteil, Urgroßelternteil) haben, die polnische Staatsbürger waren. Der Schlüssel ist der Nachweis einer ununterbrochenen Übertragungskette der Staatsbürgerschaft.',
          q2: 'Was ist, wenn mein Vorfahr vor 1920 ausgewandert ist?',
          a2: 'Eine Ausreise vor 1920 macht Sie nicht automatisch unberechtigt. Nach dem Staatsbürgerschaftsgesetz von 1920 konnten Personen, die mit Gebieten verbunden waren, die zu Polen wurden, die polnische Staatsbürgerschaft erwerben.',
          q3: 'Kann ich über die Linie meiner Großmutter beantragen?',
          a3: 'Ja, Sie können die Staatsbürgerschaft über weibliche Vorfahren geltend machen, obwohl die Regeln variieren. Wir analysieren Ihre spezifische Familienzeitleiste, um den besten rechtlichen Weg zu bestimmen.',
          q4: 'Kann ich über meine Urgroßeltern Anspruch erheben?',
          a4: 'Ja, viele erfolgreiche Fälle betreffen Urgroßeltern oder noch frühere Generationen. Der Schlüssel ist der Nachweis der ununterbrochenen Übertragungskette der Staatsbürgerschaft.',
          q5: 'Muss ich Polnisch sprechen?',
          a5: 'Nein, Sie müssen nicht Polnisch sprechen, um die Staatsbürgerschaft durch Abstammung zu erhalten. Dies ist eine Bestätigung bestehender Staatsbürgerschaftsrechte, keine Einbürgerung.'

        timeline: {
          title: 'Zeitplan',
          q1: 'Warum dauert die Bestätigung Zeit?',
          a1: 'Die Bestätigung der polnischen Staatsbürgerschaft ist ein gründlicher rechtlicher Prozess, der von Provinzgouverneuren durchgeführt wird. Der realistische Zeitplan beträgt 1,5 bis 4 Jahre aufgrund von Dokumentenprüfung, historischer Aufzeichnungsforschung und behördlichen Rückständen.',
          q2: 'Wo reiche ich ein, wenn ich außerhalb Polens lebe?',
          a2: 'Anträge werden beim zuständigen Provinzgouverneur in Polen eingereicht. Sie müssen nicht in Polen sein, um einzureichen - wir kümmern uns um alle Einreichungen und Kommunikationen in Ihrem Namen.',
          q3: 'Was passiert während der Regierungsphase?',
          a3: 'Nach der Einreichung prüft das Büro des Woiwoden Ihren Antrag. Sie können zusätzliche Nachweise anfordern. Wir reagieren professionell auf alle behördlichen Anfragen und bearbeiten alle Kommunikationen auf Polnisch.',
          q4: 'Kann der Prozess schneller sein?',
          a4: 'Wir können durch ordnungsgemäße Dokumentation, strategisches Timing und professionelle rechtliche Vertretung beschleunigen. Einige Wartezeiten sind jedoch aufgrund behördlicher Bearbeitungszeiten unvermeidlich.',
          q5: 'Was ist, wenn ich eine negative Entscheidung erhalte?',
          a5: 'Wenn eine negative Entscheidung erteilt wird, können wir Berufung oder Verwaltungsprüfung einlegen. Viele Fälle werden in der Berufung mit zusätzlichen Beweisen und stärkeren rechtlichen Argumenten gewonnen.'

          q2: 'Gibt es Zahlungspläne?',
          a2: 'Ja, wir bieten flexible Zahlungspläne an, um den Prozess zugänglich zu machen. Die Zahlung wird normalerweise in Phasen aufgeteilt, die auf Fallmeilensteine abgestimmt sind.',
          q3: 'Was beinhalten die Regierungsgebühren?',
          a3: 'Regierungsgebühren decken die Antragsbearbeitung, Dokumentenbeglaubigung und offizielle Stempel ab. Diese sind von unseren Anwaltsgebühren getrennt und variieren je nach Fall.',
          q4: 'Zahle ich, wenn mein Fall nicht erfolgreich ist?',
          a4: 'Unsere Gebührenstruktur ist fair gestaltet. Erstbewertungsgebühren decken die Fallbewertung ab. Hauptgebühren sind an erfolgreiche Einreichung und Vertretung gebunden.',
          q5: 'Was ist mit Übersetzungskosten?',

          q2: 'Was ist, wenn Aufzeichnungen zerstört wurden?',
          a2: 'Viele polnische Aufzeichnungen haben trotz Kriegen überlebt. Wir haben umfangreiche Erfahrung darin, alternative Beweise zu finden und mit Archiven weltweit zu arbeiten, um verlorene Dokumentation wiederherzustellen.',
          q3: 'Müssen Dokumente übersetzt werden?',
          a3: 'Ja, alle ausländischen Dokumente müssen von zertifizierten polnischen Übersetzern übersetzt werden. Wir koordinieren alle Übersetzungsdienste, um Genauigkeit und Rechtskonformität zu gewährleisten.',
          q4: 'Wie erhalte ich polnische Geburtsurkunden?',
          a4: 'Wir können polnische Zivilstandsregister in Ihrem Namen erhalten, indem wir Anfragen bei den entsprechenden Standesämtern in Polen einreichen. Dies ist oft ein entscheidender Schritt beim Aufbau Ihres Falls.',
          q5: 'Was ist mit Einbürgerungsunterlagen?',
          a5: 'Wenn sich ein Vorfahr in einem anderen Land einbürgerte, benötigen wir diese Aufzeichnungen, um festzustellen, ob die polnische Staatsbürgerschaft verloren ging. Wir helfen, diese Dokumente aus relevanten Nationalarchiven zu erhalten.'

          q2: 'Der Name meines Vorfahren wurde geändert - ist das ein Problem?',
          a2: 'Namensänderungen sind üblich und handhabbar. Wir helfen, Identitätskontinuität durch Dokumentation wie Namensänderungsverordnungen, Einwanderungsunterlagen und genealogische Beweise zu etablieren.',
          q3: 'Was ist, wenn ich Lücken in meinem Stammbaum habe?',
          a3: 'Fehlende Verbindungen können durch Archivrecherche, Kirchenregister, Einwanderungsdokumente und andere Quellen gefüllt werden. Wir sind darauf spezialisiert, Familiengeschichten zu rekonstruieren.',
          q4: 'Können Kinder eingeschlossen werden?',
          a4: 'Ja, sobald Sie Ihre polnische Staatsbürgerschaft bestätigen, können Ihre minderjährigen Kinder als polnische Staatsbürger registriert werden. Der Prozess ist für Kinder unter 16 Jahren unkompliziert.',
          q5: 'Was ist mit der doppelten Staatsbürgerschaft?',
          a5: 'Polen erlaubt die doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft. Die Bestätigung der polnischen Staatsbürgerschaft erfordert nicht den Verzicht auf andere Staatsbürgerschaften, und die meisten Länder (einschließlich USA, Kanada, Großbritannien) erlauben ebenfalls die doppelte Staatsbürgerschaft.'

          title: 'Éligibilité',
          q1: 'Qui est éligible à la citoyenneté polonaise par descendance?',
          a1: 'Vous pourriez être éligible si vous avez des ancêtres polonais (parent, grand-parent, arrière-grand-parent) qui étaient citoyens polonais. La clé est de prouver une chaîne ininterrompue de transmission de citoyenneté.',
          q2: 'Et si mon ancêtre est parti avant 1920?',
          a2: 'Partir avant 1920 ne vous rend pas automatiquement inéligible. Selon la loi sur la citoyenneté de 1920, les personnes liées aux territoires devenus la Pologne pouvaient acquérir la citoyenneté polonaise.',
          q3: 'Puis-je postuler par la lignée de ma grand-mère?',
          a3: 'Oui, vous pouvez revendiquer la citoyenneté par des ancêtres féminins, bien que les règles varient. Nous analysons votre chronologie familiale spécifique pour déterminer le meilleur parcours juridique.',
          q4: 'Puis-je revendiquer par mes arrière-grands-parents?',
          a4: 'Oui, de nombreux cas réussis impliquent des arrière-grands-parents ou des générations encore antérieures. La clé est de prouver la chaîne ininterrompue de transmission de citoyenneté.',
          q5: 'Dois-je parler polonais?',
          a5: 'Non, vous n\'avez pas besoin de parler polonais pour obtenir la citoyenneté par descendance. Il s\'agit d\'une confirmation de droits de citoyenneté existants, pas de naturalisation.'
        },
        
        timeline: {
          title: 'Calendrier',
          q1: 'Pourquoi la confirmation prend-elle du temps?',
          a1: 'La confirmation de la citoyenneté polonaise est un processus juridique approfondi géré par les gouverneurs provinciaux. Le calendrier réaliste est de 1,5 à 4 ans en raison de la vérification des documents, de la recherche de dossiers historiques et des arriérés gouvernementaux.',
          q2: 'Où dois-je déposer si je vis hors de Pologne?',
          a2: 'Les demandes sont déposées auprès du gouverneur provincial approprié en Pologne. Vous n\'avez pas besoin d\'être en Pologne pour déposer - nous gérons toutes les soumissions et communications en votre nom.',
          q3: 'Que se passe-t-il pendant la phase gouvernementale?',
          a3: 'Après le dépôt, le bureau du voïvode examine votre demande. Ils peuvent demander des preuves supplémentaires. Nous répondons professionnellement à toutes les demandes gouvernementales et gérons toutes les communications en polonais.',
          q4: 'Le processus peut-il être plus rapide?',
          a4: 'Nous pouvons aider à accélérer grâce à une documentation appropriée, un calendrier stratégique et une représentation juridique professionnelle. Cependant, une certaine attente est inévitable en raison des délais de traitement gouvernementaux.',
          q5: 'Que se passe-t-il si je reçois une décision négative?',
          a5: 'Si une décision négative est rendue, nous pouvons déposer un appel ou un examen administratif. De nombreux cas sont gagnés en appel avec des preuves supplémentaires et des arguments juridiques plus solides.'

        costs: {
          title: 'Coûts',
          q1: 'Quels sont les coûts totaux?',
          a1: 'Les coûts totaux varient en fonction de la complexité du cas, de la disponibilité des documents et des services requis. Nous fournissons des prix transparents sans frais cachés après l\'évaluation initiale du cas.',
          q2: 'Des plans de paiement sont-ils disponibles?',
          a2: 'Oui, nous offrons des plans de paiement flexibles pour rendre le processus accessible. Le paiement est généralement divisé en phases alignées sur les jalons du cas.',
          q3: 'Que comprennent les frais gouvernementaux?',
          a3: 'Les frais gouvernementaux couvrent le traitement des demandes, la certification des documents et les timbres officiels. Ceux-ci sont séparés de nos honoraires juridiques et varient selon les cas.',
          q4: 'Dois-je payer si mon cas n\'est pas couronné de succès?',
          a4: 'Notre structure de frais est conçue pour être équitable. Les frais d\'évaluation initiale couvrent l\'évaluation du cas. Les frais principaux sont liés au dépôt et à la représentation réussis.',
          q5: 'Qu\'en est-il des frais de traduction?',
          a5: 'Les coûts de traduction certifiée dépendent du nombre et du type de documents. Nous travaillons avec des traducteurs certifiés et fournissons des estimations de coûts précises à l\'avance.'

          q2: 'Et si les dossiers ont été détruits?',
          a2: 'De nombreux dossiers polonais ont survécu malgré les guerres. Nous avons une vaste expérience dans la recherche de preuves alternatives et le travail avec des archives du monde entier pour reconstruire la documentation perdue.',
          q3: 'Les documents doivent-ils être traduits?',
          a3: 'Oui, tous les documents étrangers doivent être traduits par des traducteurs polonais certifiés. Nous coordonnons tous les services de traduction pour garantir l\'exactitude et la conformité légale.',
          q4: 'Comment obtenir des actes de naissance polonais?',
          a4: 'Nous pouvons obtenir des registres civils polonais en votre nom en déposant des demandes auprès des bureaux d\'état civil appropriés en Pologne. C\'est souvent une étape cruciale dans la construction de votre cas.',
          q5: 'Qu\'en est-il des dossiers de naturalisation?',
          a5: 'Si un ancêtre s\'est naturalisé dans un autre pays, nous avons besoin de ces dossiers pour déterminer si la citoyenneté polonaise a été perdue. Nous aidons à obtenir ces documents auprès des archives nationales pertinentes.'

        issues: {
          title: 'Problèmes Courants',
          q1: 'Et si mon ancêtre s\'est naturalisé?',
          a1: 'La naturalisation dans un autre pays avant 1951 pourrait affecter la transmission de la citoyenneté. Cependant, de nombreux cas réussissent toujours selon le calendrier et les circonstances. Nous analysons chaque situation avec soin.',
          q2: 'Le nom de mon ancêtre a été changé - est-ce un problème?',
          a2: 'Les changements de nom sont courants et gérables. Nous aidons à établir la continuité de l\'identité par la documentation telle que les décrets de changement de nom, les dossiers d\'immigration et les preuves généalogiques.',
          q3: 'Et si j\'ai des lacunes dans mon arbre généalogique?',
          a3: 'Les liens manquants peuvent être comblés par des recherches d\'archives, des registres d\'église, des documents d\'immigration et d\'autres sources. Nous nous spécialisons dans la reconstruction des histoires familiales.',
          q4: 'Les enfants peuvent-ils être inclus?',
          a4: 'Oui, une fois que vous confirmez votre citoyenneté polonaise, vos enfants mineurs peuvent être enregistrés comme citoyens polonais. Le processus est simple pour les enfants de moins de 16 ans.',
          q5: 'Qu\'en est-il de la double citoyenneté?',
          a5: 'La Pologne permet la double citoyenneté. Confirmer la citoyenneté polonaise n\'exige pas de renoncer à d\'autres citoyennetés, et la plupart des pays (y compris les États-Unis, le Canada, le Royaume-Uni) permettent également la double citoyenneté.'

          title: 'Право на гражданство',
          q1: 'Кто имеет право на польское гражданство по происхождению?',
          a1: 'Вы можете иметь право, если у вас есть польские предки (родитель, дедушка/бабушка, прадедушка/прабабушка), которые были польскими гражданами. Ключ в том, чтобы доказать непрерывную цепочку передачи гражданства.',
          q2: 'Что, если мой предок уехал до 1920 года?',
          a2: 'Отъезд до 1920 года не делает вас автоматически неправомочным. По Закону о гражданстве 1920 года люди, связанные с территориями, которые стали Польшей, могли приобрести польское гражданство.',
          q3: 'Могу ли я подать заявку по линии бабушки?',
          a3: 'Да, вы можете претендовать на гражданство через женских предков, хотя правила различаются. Мы анализируем вашу конкретную семейную хронологию, чтобы определить наилучший юридический путь.',
          q4: 'Могу ли я претендовать через прадедушку/прабабушку?',
          a4: 'Да, многие успешные случаи включают прадедушек/прабабушек или еще более ранние поколения. Ключ в том, чтобы доказать непрерывную цепочку передачи гражданства.',
          q5: 'Нужно ли мне говорить по-польски?',
          a5: 'Нет, вам не нужно говорить по-польски, чтобы получить гражданство по происхождению. Это подтверждение существующих прав на гражданство, а не натурализация.'
        },
        
        timeline: {
          title: 'Сроки',
          q1: 'Почему подтверждение занимает время?',
          a1: 'Подтверждение польского гражданства - это тщательный юридический процесс, проводимый губернаторами провинций. Реалистичные сроки составляют от 1,5 до 4 лет из-за проверки документов, исследования исторических записей и правительственных задолженностей.',
          q2: 'Где я подаю документы, если живу за пределами Польши?',
          a2: 'Заявления подаются соответствующему губернатору провинции в Польше. Вам не нужно быть в Польше для подачи - мы обрабатываем все заявки и коммуникации от вашего имени.',
          q3: 'Что происходит на государственном этапе?',
          a3: 'После подачи заявления Управление воеводы рассматривает вашу заявку. Они могут запросить дополнительные доказательства. Мы профессионально отвечаем на все государственные запросы и обрабатываем все коммуникации на польском языке.',
          q4: 'Может ли процесс быть быстрее?',
          a4: 'Мы можем помочь ускорить процесс с помощью правильной документации, стратегического времени и профессионального юридического представительства. Однако некоторое ожидание неизбежно из-за сроков обработки государством.',
          q5: 'Что, если я получу отрицательное решение?',
          a5: 'Если выносится отрицательное решение, мы можем подать апелляцию или административный пересмотр. Многие дела выигрываются в апелляции с дополнительными доказательствами и более сильными юридическими аргументами.'

        costs: {
          title: 'Стоимость',
          q1: 'Какова общая стоимость?',
          a1: 'Общая стоимость варьируется в зависимости от сложности дела, доступности документов и необходимых услуг. Мы предоставляем прозрачные цены без скрытых платежей после первоначальной оценки дела.',
          q2: 'Доступны ли планы оплаты?',
          a2: 'Да, мы предлагаем гибкие планы оплаты, чтобы сделать процесс доступным. Оплата обычно делится на этапы, согласованные с вехами дела.',
          q3: 'Что включают государственные сборы?',
          a3: 'Государственные сборы покрывают обработку заявлений, сертификацию документов и официальные печати. Они отдельны от наших юридических гонораров и варьируются в зависимости от дела.',
          q4: 'Плачу ли я, если мое дело не успешно?',
          a4: 'Наша структура гонораров разработана справедливо. Сборы за первоначальную оценку покрывают оценку дела. Основные гонорары связаны с успешной подачей и представительством.',
          q5: 'А как насчет расходов на перевод?',
          a5: 'Расходы на сертифицированный перевод зависят от количества и типа документов. Мы работаем с сертифицированными переводчиками и предоставляем точные оценки расходов заранее.'

          q2: 'Что, если записи были уничтожены?',
          a2: 'Многие польские записи сохранились, несмотря на войны. У нас есть обширный опыт поиска альтернативных доказательств и работы с архивами по всему миру для восстановления утерянной документации.',
          q3: 'Нужно ли переводить документы?',
          a3: 'Да, все иностранные документы должны быть переведены сертифицированными польскими переводчиками. Мы координируем все услуги перевода для обеспечения точности и соблюдения закона.',
          q4: 'Как получить польские свидетельства о рождении?',
          a4: 'Мы можем получить польские гражданские записи от вашего имени, подав заявки в соответствующие отделы ЗАГС в Польше. Это часто важный шаг в построении вашего дела.',
          q5: 'А как насчет записей о натурализации?',
          a5: 'Если предок натурализовался в другой стране, нам нужны эти записи, чтобы определить, было ли потеряно польское гражданство. Мы помогаем получить эти документы из соответствующих национальных архивов.'

        issues: {
          title: 'Распространенные Проблемы',
          q1: 'Что, если мой предок натурализовался?',
          a1: 'Натурализация в другой стране до 1951 года может повлиять на передачу гражданства. Однако многие дела все равно успешны в зависимости от времени и обстоятельств. Мы тщательно анализируем каждую ситуацию.',
          q2: 'Имя моего предка было изменено - это проблема?',
          a2: 'Изменения имени распространены и управляемы. Мы помогаем установить непрерывность личности через документацию, такую как указы об изменении имени, иммиграционные записи и генеалогические доказательства.',
          q3: 'Что, если у меня есть пробелы в моем семейном древе?',
          a3: 'Отсутствующие звенья можно заполнить через архивные исследования, церковные записи, иммиграционные документы и другие источники. Мы специализируемся на восстановлении семейных историй.',
          q4: 'Могут ли дети быть включены?',
          a4: 'Да, как только вы подтвердите свое польское гражданство, ваши несовершеннолетние дети могут быть зарегистрированы как польские граждане. Процесс прост для детей до 16 лет.',
          q5: 'А как насчет двойного гражданства?',
          a5: 'Польша разрешает двойное гражданство. Подтверждение польского гражданства не требует отказа от других гражданств, и большинство стран (включая США, Канаду, Великобританию) также разрешают двойное гражданство.'

          q1: 'Хто має право на польське громадянство за походженням?',
          a1: 'Ви можете мати право, якщо у вас є польські предки (батько/мати, дідусь/бабуся, прадідусь/прабабуся), які були польськими громадянами. Ключ у тому, щоб довести безперервний ланцюг передачі громадянства.',
          q2: 'Що, якщо мій предок виїхав до 1920 року?',
          a2: 'Від\'їзд до 1920 року не робить вас автоматично неправомочним. За Законом про громадянство 1920 року люди, пов\'язані з територіями, що стали Польщею, могли набути польське громадянство.',
          q3: 'Чи можу я подати заявку за лінією бабусі?',
          a3: 'Так, ви можете претендувати на громадянство через жіночих предків, хоча правила різняться. Ми аналізуємо вашу конкретну сімейну хронологію, щоб визначити найкращий юридичний шлях.',
          q4: 'Чи можу я претендувати через прадідуся/прабабусю?',
          a4: 'Так, багато успішних випадків включають прадідусів/прабабусь або ще більш ранні покоління. Ключ у тому, щоб довести безперервний ланцюг передачі громадянства.',
          q5: 'Чи потрібно мені говорити польською?',
          a5: 'Ні, вам не потрібно говорити польською, щоб отримати громадянство за походженням. Це підтвердження існуючих прав на громадянство, а не натуралізація.'

          q1: 'Чому підтвердження займає час?',
          a1: 'Підтвердження польського громадянства - це ретельний юридичний процес, що проводиться губернаторами провінцій. Реалістичні терміни становлять від 1,5 до 4 років через перевірку документів, дослідження історичних записів та урядові затримки.',
          q2: 'Де я подаю документи, якщо живу за межами Польщі?',
          a2: 'Заяви подаються відповідному губернатору провінції в Польщі. Вам не потрібно бути в Польщі для подання - ми обробляємо всі заявки та комунікації від вашого імені.',

          q4: 'Чи може процес бути швидшим?',
          a4: 'Ми можемо допомогти прискорити процес за допомогою правильної документації, стратегічного часу та професійного юридичного представництва. Однак деяке очікування неминуче через терміни обробки державою.',
          q5: 'Що, якщо я отримаю негативне рішення?',
          a5: 'Якщо виноситься негативне рішення, ми можемо подати апеляцію або адміністративний перегляд. Багато справ виграються в апеляції з додатковими доказами та сильнішими юридичними аргументами.'
