        q1: 'Who is eligible for Polish citizenship by descent?',
        a1: 'You may be eligible if you have Polish ancestors (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent) who were Polish citizens. The key is proving an unbroken chain of citizenship transmission from your Polish ancestor to you. This includes individuals of Polish and Polish-Jewish descent from around the world.',
        q2: 'What if my ancestor left before 1920?',
        a2: 'Leaving before 1920 does not automatically make you ineligible. Under the 1920 Citizenship Act and related treaty provisions, people connected to territories that became Poland could acquire (or be deemed to have acquired) Polish citizenship based on domicile/right of residence—even if they had emigrated earlier. We assess where the ancestor was domiciled on 31 January 1920 and shortly after. These cases are complex and document-heavy—our specialty.',
        q3: 'Can I apply through my grandmother\'s line?',
        a3: 'Yes, you can claim citizenship through female ancestors, though the rules vary depending on when your ancestor had children. Polish law changed over time regarding maternal transmission of citizenship. We analyze your specific family timeline to determine the best legal pathway through maternal lineage.',
        q4: 'Can I claim through my great-grandparents?',
        a4: 'Yes, many successful cases involve great-grandparents or even earlier generations. The key is proving the unbroken chain of citizenship transmission through each generation. The further back your Polish ancestor, the more complex the documentation requirements, but it\'s absolutely possible with proper legal representation.',
        q5: 'Do I need to speak Polish?',
        a5: 'No, you don\'t need to speak Polish to obtain citizenship by descent. This is confirmation of existing citizenship rights, not naturalization. Our team handles all communications with Polish authorities in Polish, and all documents are professionally translated by certified translators.',
        q6: 'Why does confirmation take time?',
        a6: 'Polish citizenship confirmation is a thorough legal process handled by provincial governors (voivodes) in Poland. The realistic timeline is 1.5 to 4 years because: (1) Polish authorities must verify all documents and legal claims thoroughly, (2) Historical records often require extensive research and verification, (3) Government offices in Poland face significant backlogs, (4) Complex cases involving pre-1920 emigration or multiple jurisdictions require additional scrutiny. We provide honest timelines based on actual case experience, not marketing promises.',
        q7: 'Where do I file if I live outside Poland?',
        a7: 'Applications are filed with the appropriate provincial governor (voivode) in Poland, determined by your ancestor\'s last place of residence in Poland or where their records are held. You don\'t need to be in Poland to file - we handle all submissions and communications with Polish authorities on your behalf. Most of our clients never visit Poland during the confirmation process.',
        q8: 'What happens during the government phase?',
        a8: 'After filing, the Mazovian Voivode\'s Office reviews your application and supporting documents. They may request additional evidence or clarification. This is when our legal expertise becomes crucial - we respond to all government requests professionally and promptly. The office will eventually issue either a positive confirmation decision or request for additional information. We handle all communications with Polish authorities in Polish.',
        q9: 'Can the process be faster?',
        a9: 'We offer three acceleration strategies: PUSH (regular communication with authorities), NUDGE (strategic intervention at key points), and SIT-DOWN (in-person meetings with decision-makers). While these can help move cases forward, realistic timeline expectations remain important - Polish citizenship confirmation is a thorough legal process. We explain these options in detail during consultation.',
        q10: 'What if I get a negative decision?',
        a10: 'In the rare case of a negative decision, we can file an appeal to the Ministry of Interior within 14 days. Our success rate on appeals is strong because we thoroughly analyze the reasoning and present compelling legal arguments. However, our comprehensive preparation and legal expertise mean most of our cases receive positive decisions without needing appeals.',
        q11: 'What documents do I need from my side?',
        a11: 'You\'ll need: your passport, your birth certificate, your parents\' birth/marriage certificates, and any documents about your Polish ancestor (birth, marriage, emigration, naturalization, military service). The specific requirements vary by case. We provide a detailed checklist after initial assessment and guide you through obtaining any missing documents.',
        q12: 'What if I don\'t have all the documents?',
        a12: 'Missing documents are common. We help you obtain them through: (1) Polish archives - we conduct extensive searches in Polish and international archives, (2) Local authorities - we guide you in requesting documents from your country of residence, (3) Family sources - we help identify documents that might be in family possession. Our archive research partnerships mean we can often find documents you didn\'t know existed.',
        q13: 'Do documents need translation?',
        a13: 'Yes, all non-Polish documents must be translated by Polish certified sworn translators. We handle this through our translations workflow - documents can be translated on our portal with AI translation service, then certified by Polish Certified Sworn Translators. We also double-check all translations for accuracy with an independent agent to ensure quality.',
        q14: 'What are Polish civil acts?',
        a14: 'Polish civil acts (akty stanu cywilnego) are official birth and marriage certificates issued by Polish civil registry offices. We can obtain these for your Polish ancestors by submitting applications to the relevant Polish Civil Registry office. This process is supervised by our dedicated Civil Acts Agent and takes approximately 4-8 weeks depending on the specific registry office.',
        q15: 'How do archives searches work?',
        a15: 'We conduct comprehensive searches in Polish state archives, Jewish historical institutes, and international archives to find records of your ancestors. This includes birth records, marriage records, residence permits, emigration documents, and citizenship records. Our research partnerships with Polish and international archives mean we have access to databases and collections that individuals cannot access on their own.',
        q16: 'What are the total costs?',
        a16: 'Our fees are structured transparently: Initial assessment and consultation, Main legal service fee (varies by case complexity), Document translation costs, Archive search fees (when needed), Polish civil acts fees (when needed), Optional acceleration services (PUSH/NUDGE/SIT-DOWN). We provide detailed cost breakdown during initial consultation based on your specific case. Payment is typically structured in stages aligned with the process.',
        q17: 'Is there an advance payment?',
        a17: 'Yes, we require an advance payment after initial assessment and before beginning legal work. This covers initial case setup, account creation on our portal, and preparation of Powers of Attorney. The advance is deducted from the total service fee. We explain the complete fee structure during consultation.',
        q18: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
        a18: 'We accept bank transfers, credit cards, and can accommodate cryptocurrency payments for international clients. Detailed payment instructions are provided after you decide to proceed. We issue official invoices for all payments.',
        q19: 'Are there hidden fees?',
        a19: 'No. We believe in complete transparency. All potential costs are disclosed during initial consultation, including optional services. If additional work becomes necessary during the process (such as unexpected archive searches), we discuss and agree on costs before proceeding. There are no surprise charges.',
        q20: 'What if I need to stop the process?',
        a20: 'We understand circumstances change. If you need to pause or stop the process, we discuss your options and handle any work completed to that point professionally. Our goal is always to serve your interests while maintaining ethical professional standards.',

        q1: '¿Quién es elegible para la ciudadanía polaca por descendencia?',
        a1: 'Puede ser elegible si tiene ancestros polacos (padre, abuelo, bisabuelo) que fueron ciudadanos polacos. La clave es demostrar una cadena ininterrumpida de transmisión de ciudadanía desde su ancestro polaco hasta usted. Esto incluye a personas de ascendencia polaca y judío-polaca de todo el mundo.',
        q2: '¿Qué pasa si mi ancestro se fue antes de 1920?',
        a2: 'Irse antes de 1920 no lo hace automáticamente inelegible. Bajo la Ley de Ciudadanía de 1920 y disposiciones de tratados relacionados, las personas conectadas a territorios que se convirtieron en Polonia podrían adquirir (o ser consideradas como que adquirieron) la ciudadanía polaca basándose en domicilio/derecho de residencia, incluso si habían emigrado antes. Evaluamos dónde estaba domiciliado el ancestro el 31 de enero de 1920 y poco después. Estos casos son complejos y requieren muchos documentos, nuestra especialidad.',
        q3: '¿Puedo aplicar a través de la línea de mi abuela?',
        a3: 'Sí, puede reclamar la ciudadanía a través de ancestros femeninos, aunque las reglas varían dependiendo de cuándo su ancestro tuvo hijos. La ley polaca cambió con el tiempo con respecto a la transmisión materna de la ciudadanía. Analizamos su línea de tiempo familiar específica para determinar el mejor camino legal a través del linaje materno.',
        q4: '¿Puedo reclamar a través de mis bisabuelos?',
        a4: 'Sí, muchos casos exitosos involucran bisabuelos o generaciones aún anteriores. La clave es demostrar la cadena ininterrumpida de transmisión de ciudadanía a través de cada generación. Cuanto más atrás esté su ancestro polaco, más complejos son los requisitos de documentación, pero es absolutamente posible con la representación legal adecuada.',
        q5: '¿Necesito hablar polaco?',
        a5: 'No, no necesita hablar polaco para obtener la ciudadanía por descendencia. Esto es una confirmación de derechos de ciudadanía existentes, no naturalización. Nuestro equipo maneja todas las comunicaciones con las autoridades polacas en polaco, y todos los documentos son traducidos profesionalmente por traductores certificados.',
        q6: '¿Por qué la confirmación toma tiempo?',
        a6: 'La confirmación de ciudadanía polaca es un proceso legal exhaustivo manejado por gobernadores provinciales (voivodas) en Polonia. El cronograma realista es de 1.5 a 4 años porque: (1) Las autoridades polacas deben verificar todos los documentos y reclamos legales exhaustivamente, (2) Los registros históricos a menudo requieren investigación y verificación extensas, (3) Las oficinas gubernamentales en Polonia enfrentan retrasos significativos, (4) Los casos complejos que involucran emigración pre-1920 o múltiples jurisdicciones requieren escrutinio adicional. Proporcionamos cronogramas honestos basados en la experiencia real de casos, no promesas de marketing.',
        q7: '¿Dónde presento si vivo fuera de Polonia?',
        a7: 'Las solicitudes se presentan ante el gobernador provincial (voivoda) apropiado en Polonia, determinado por el último lugar de residencia de su ancestro en Polonia o donde se guardan sus registros. No necesita estar en Polonia para presentar - manejamos todas las presentaciones y comunicaciones con las autoridades polacas en su nombre. La mayoría de nuestros clientes nunca visitan Polonia durante el proceso de confirmación.',
        q8: '¿Qué sucede durante la fase gubernamental?',
        a8: 'Después de presentar, la Oficina del Voivoda de Mazovia revisa su solicitud y documentos de apoyo. Pueden solicitar evidencia o aclaración adicional. Aquí es cuando nuestra experiencia legal se vuelve crucial: respondemos a todas las solicitudes del gobierno de manera profesional y rápida. La oficina eventualmente emitirá una decisión de confirmación positiva o solicitará información adicional. Manejamos todas las comunicaciones con las autoridades polacas en polaco.',
        q9: '¿Puede ser más rápido el proceso?',
        a9: 'Ofrecemos tres estrategias de aceleración: PUSH (comunicación regular con autoridades), NUDGE (intervención estratégica en puntos clave) y SIT-DOWN (reuniones en persona con tomadores de decisiones). Si bien estos pueden ayudar a avanzar los casos, las expectativas de cronograma realistas siguen siendo importantes: la confirmación de ciudadanía polaca es un proceso legal exhaustivo. Explicamos estas opciones en detalle durante la consulta.',
        q10: '¿Qué pasa si recibo una decisión negativa?',
        a10: 'En el raro caso de una decisión negativa, podemos presentar una apelación al Ministerio del Interior dentro de 14 días. Nuestra tasa de éxito en apelaciones es sólida porque analizamos exhaustivamente el razonamiento y presentamos argumentos legales convincentes. Sin embargo, nuestra preparación integral y experiencia legal significan que la mayoría de nuestros casos reciben decisiones positivas sin necesidad de apelaciones.',
        q11: '¿Qué documentos necesito de mi parte?',
        a11: 'Necesitará: su pasaporte, su certificado de nacimiento, los certificados de nacimiento/matrimonio de sus padres y cualquier documento sobre su ancestro polaco (nacimiento, matrimonio, emigración, naturalización, servicio militar). Los requisitos específicos varían según el caso. Proporcionamos una lista de verificación detallada después de la evaluación inicial y lo guiamos para obtener cualquier documento faltante.',
        q12: '¿Qué pasa si no tengo todos los documentos?',
        a12: 'Los documentos faltantes son comunes. Lo ayudamos a obtenerlos a través de: (1) Archivos polacos - realizamos búsquedas extensas en archivos polacos e internacionales, (2) Autoridades locales - lo guiamos para solicitar documentos de su país de residencia, (3) Fuentes familiares - ayudamos a identificar documentos que podrían estar en posesión de la familia. Nuestras asociaciones de investigación de archivos significan que a menudo podemos encontrar documentos que no sabía que existían.',
        q13: '¿Los documentos necesitan traducción?',
        a13: 'Sí, todos los documentos que no sean en polaco deben ser traducidos por traductores jurados certificados polacos. Manejamos esto a través de nuestro flujo de trabajo de traducciones: los documentos pueden traducirse en nuestro portal con servicio de traducción IA, luego certificarse por Traductores Jurados Certificados Polacos. También verificamos dos veces todas las traducciones para verificar la precisión con un agente independiente para garantizar la calidad.',
        q14: '¿Qué son las actas civiles polacas?',
        a14: 'Las actas civiles polacas (akty stanu cywilnego) son certificados oficiales de nacimiento y matrimonio emitidos por las oficinas de registro civil polacas. Podemos obtenerlas para sus ancestros polacos presentando solicitudes a la Oficina de Registro Civil Polaca relevante. Este proceso es supervisado por nuestro Agente de Actas Civiles dedicado y toma aproximadamente 4-8 semanas dependiendo de la oficina de registro específica.',
        q15: '¿Cómo funcionan las búsquedas de archivos?',
        a15: 'Realizamos búsquedas exhaustivas en archivos estatales polacos, institutos históricos judíos y archivos internacionales para encontrar registros de sus ancestros. Esto incluye registros de nacimiento, registros de matrimonio, permisos de residencia, documentos de emigración y registros de ciudadanía. Nuestras asociaciones de investigación con archivos polacos e internacionales significan que tenemos acceso a bases de datos y colecciones a las que los individuos no pueden acceder por sí mismos.',
        q16: '¿Cuáles son los costos totales?',
        a16: 'Nuestras tarifas están estructuradas de manera transparente: Evaluación inicial y consulta, Tarifa principal de servicio legal (varía según la complejidad del caso), Costos de traducción de documentos, Tarifas de búsqueda en archivos (cuando sea necesario), Tarifas de actas civiles polacas (cuando sea necesario), Servicios de aceleración opcionales (PUSH/NUDGE/SIT-DOWN). Proporcionamos un desglose detallado de costos durante la consulta inicial basado en su caso específico. El pago generalmente se estructura en etapas alineadas con el proceso.',
        q17: '¿Hay un pago anticipado?',
        a17: 'Sí, requerimos un pago anticipado después de la evaluación inicial y antes de comenzar el trabajo legal. Esto cubre la configuración inicial del caso, la creación de la cuenta en nuestro portal y la preparación de Poderes Notariales. El anticipo se deduce de la tarifa total de servicio. Explicamos la estructura completa de tarifas durante la consulta.',
        q18: '¿Qué métodos de pago aceptan?',
        a18: 'Aceptamos transferencias bancarias, tarjetas de crédito y podemos acomodar pagos en criptomonedas para clientes internacionales. Se proporcionan instrucciones de pago detalladas después de que decida proceder. Emitimos facturas oficiales para todos los pagos.',
        q19: '¿Hay tarifas ocultas?',
        a19: 'No. Creemos en la transparencia completa. Todos los costos potenciales se divulgan durante la consulta inicial, incluidos los servicios opcionales. Si se hace necesario un trabajo adicional durante el proceso (como búsquedas de archivos inesperadas), discutimos y acordamos los costos antes de proceder. No hay cargos sorpresa.',
        q20: '¿Qué pasa si necesito detener el proceso?',
        a20: 'Entendemos que las circunstancias cambian. Si necesita pausar o detener el proceso, discutimos sus opciones y manejamos cualquier trabajo completado hasta ese punto de manera profesional. Nuestro objetivo es siempre servir a sus intereses mientras mantenemos estándares profesionales éticos.',
