    q1: 'Who is eligible for Polish citizenship by descent?',
    a1: 'You may be eligible if you have Polish ancestors (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent) who were Polish citizens. The key is proving an unbroken chain of citizenship transmission from your Polish ancestor to you. This includes individuals of Polish and Polish-Jewish descent from around the world.',
    q2: 'What if my ancestor left before 1920?',
    a2: 'Leaving before 1920 does not automatically make you ineligible. Under the 1920 Citizenship Act and related treaty provisions, people connected to territories that became Poland could acquire (or be deemed to have acquired) Polish citizenship based on domicile/right of residence—even if they had emigrated earlier. We assess where the ancestor was domiciled on 31 January 1920 and shortly after. These cases are complex and document-heavy—our specialty.',
    q3: 'Can I apply through my grandmother\'s line?',
    a3: 'Yes, you can claim citizenship through female ancestors, though the rules vary depending on when your ancestor had children. Polish law changed over time regarding maternal transmission of citizenship. We analyze your specific family timeline to determine the best legal pathway through maternal lineage.',
    q4: 'Can I claim through my great-grandparents?',
    a4: 'Yes, many successful cases involve great-grandparents or even earlier generations. The key is proving the unbroken chain of citizenship transmission through each generation. The further back your Polish ancestor, the more complex the documentation requirements, but it\'s absolutely possible with proper legal representation.',
    q5: 'Do I need to speak Polish?',
    a5: 'No, you don\'t need to speak Polish to obtain citizenship by descent. This is confirmation of existing citizenship rights, not naturalization. Our team handles all communications with Polish authorities in Polish, and all documents are professionally translated by certified translators.'
