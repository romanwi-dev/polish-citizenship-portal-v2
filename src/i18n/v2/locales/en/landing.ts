    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    searchPlaceholder: "Search questions...",
    eligibility: {
      title: "Eligibility",
      q1: "Who qualifies for Polish citizenship?",
      a1: "Anyone with at least one Polish ancestor (parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent) may qualify under Polish citizenship law.",
      q2: "Does my ancestor need to have been born in Poland?",
      a2: "Not necessarily. The key factor is whether they held Polish citizenship, which may have been acquired by birth, descent, or naturalization.",
      q3: "Can I qualify if my ancestor naturalized in another country?",
      a3: "It depends on when they naturalized. If before 1951, you may still qualify depending on specific circumstances.",
      q4: "Do I need to speak Polish?",
      a4: "No. There is no language requirement for citizenship by descent.",
      q5: "Is there an age limit?",
      a5: "No. Polish citizenship by descent has no age restrictions."
    },
    timeline: {
      title: "Timeline & Process",
      q1: "How long does the entire process take?",
      a1: "Typically 12-24 months from initial consultation to citizenship confirmation, depending on case complexity and government processing times.",

      a2: "Yes, we offer expedited services that can reduce timelines by up to 40% through priority processing and direct government liaison.",
      q3: "Do I need to visit Poland during the process?",
      a3: "Not necessarily. Many cases can be completed entirely remotely, though some clients choose to visit for passport pickup.",
      q4: "What happens if my application is rejected?",
      a4: "We only accept cases we're confident will succeed. In the rare event of rejection, we provide a full refund and appeal assistance.",
      q5: "Can I track my application progress?",

    },
    costs: {
      title: "Costs & Payment",
      q1: "What's included in your fees?",
      a1: "Everything: eligibility assessment, genealogical research, document procurement, translations, legal fees, and government filing fees.",
      q2: "Are there any hidden costs?",
      a2: "No. Our pricing is fully transparent. The only additional costs would be travel if you choose to visit Poland.",
      q3: "Do you offer payment plans?",
      a3: "Yes. We offer flexible payment plans with installments spread across major case milestones.",
      q4: "What if I already have some documents?",
      a4: "We'll review what you have and adjust our services accordingly, potentially reducing your overall cost.",
      q5: "Is there a refund policy?",
      a5: "Yes. If we determine after our initial assessment that you don't qualify, we provide a full refund."
    },
    documents: {
      title: "Documents",
      q1: "What documents do I need to provide?",
      a1: "Initially, just your birth certificate and any information about your Polish ancestor. We'll obtain the rest.",
      q2: "What if I don't have my ancestor's documents?",
      a2: "That's our specialty. We conduct comprehensive genealogical research to locate all required documents.",
      q3: "Do documents need to be translated?",
      a3: "Yes. All non-Polish documents must be translated by certified translators. This is included in our service.",
      q4: "How are documents verified for authenticity?",
      a4: "Documents are obtained directly from official sources and undergo apostille or legalization as required.",
      q5: "Can I use digital copies of documents?",
      a5: "For initial assessment, yes. For filing, we'll need certified copies which we can obtain on your behalf."
    },
    issues: {
      title: "Common Issues",
      q1: "What if my surname has changed over generations?",
      a1: "Very common. We establish the connection through genealogical research and documentation of name changes.",
      q2: "My ancestor's birth records were destroyed. Can I still apply?",
      a2: "Often, yes. We use alternative documentation methods and evidence to establish ancestry.",
      q3: "What if records show my ancestor renounced Polish citizenship?",
      a3: "We need to review the specific circumstances. Some renunciations weren't legally valid under Polish law.",
      q4: "Can I apply if I've been convicted of a crime?",
      a4: "Possibly. It depends on the nature and timing of the conviction. We evaluate each case individually.",
      q5: "What if I'm already a citizen of another EU country?",
      a5: "Poland allows dual citizenship. Having EU citizenship doesn't disqualify you."
