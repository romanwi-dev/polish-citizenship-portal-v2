      a1: 'If you have a Polish ancestor (parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent) who was a Polish citizen, you likely qualify through descent. Key factors: did they maintain citizenship, when did they naturalize elsewhere (if applicable), and document availability.',
      q2: 'How long does the process take?',
      a2: 'Standard timeline is 18-36 months from application to passport. Factors include document availability, archive response times, and government processing. Our PUSH schemes can accelerate cases experiencing delays.',
      q3: 'What if I\'m missing family documents?',
      a3: 'Missing documents are common. We conduct extensive archive searches in Poland, access church records, immigration records, and other sources. We specialize in reconstructing family histories even with significant gaps.',
      q4: 'Can my children be included?',
      a4: 'Yes! Once your Polish citizenship is confirmed, your minor children can be registered as Polish citizens. The process is straightforward for children under 16 and doesn\'t require separate full applications.',
      q5: 'What about dual citizenship?',
