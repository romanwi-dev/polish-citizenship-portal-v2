      // Eligibility questions
      q1: 'Who is eligible for Polish citizenship by descent?',
      a1: 'You may be eligible if you have Polish ancestors (parent, grandparent, great-grandparent) who were Polish citizens. The key is proving an unbroken chain of citizenship transmission from your Polish ancestor to you. This includes individuals of Polish and Polish-Jewish descent from around the world.',
      q2: 'What if my ancestor left before 1920?',
      a2: 'Leaving before 1920 does not automatically make you ineligible. Under the 1920 Citizenship Act and related treaty provisions, people connected to territories that became Poland could acquire (or be deemed to have acquired) Polish citizenship based on domicile/right of residence—even if they had emigrated earlier. We assess where the ancestor was domiciled on 31 January 1920 and shortly after. These cases are complex and document-heavy—our specialty.',
      q3: 'Can I apply through my grandmother\'s line?',
      a3: 'Yes, you can claim citizenship through female ancestors, though the rules vary depending on when your ancestor had children. Polish law changed over time regarding maternal transmission of citizenship. We analyze your specific family timeline to determine the best legal pathway through maternal lineage.',
      q4: 'Can I claim through my great-grandparents?',
      a4: 'Yes, many successful cases involve great-grandparents or even earlier generations. The key is proving the unbroken chain of citizenship transmission through each generation. The further back your Polish ancestor, the more complex the documentation requirements, but it\'s absolutely possible with proper legal representation.',
      q5: 'Do I need to speak Polish?',
      a5: 'No, you don\'t need to speak Polish to obtain citizenship by descent. This is confirmation of existing citizenship rights, not naturalization. Our team handles all communications with Polish authorities in Polish, and all documents are professionally translated by certified translators.',
      
      // Timeline questions  
      q6: 'Why does confirmation take time?',
      a6: 'Polish citizenship confirmation is a thorough legal process handled by provincial governors (voivodes) in Poland. The realistic timeline is 1.5 to 4 years because: (1) Polish authorities must verify all documents and legal claims thoroughly, (2) Historical records often require extensive research and verification, (3) Government offices in Poland face significant backlogs, (4) Complex cases involving pre-1920 emigration or multiple jurisdictions require additional scrutiny. We provide honest timelines based on actual case experience, not marketing promises.',
      q7: 'Where do I file if I live outside Poland?',
      a7: 'Applications are filed with the appropriate provincial governor (voivode) in Poland, determined by your ancestor\'s last place of residence in Poland or where their records are held. You don\'t need to be in Poland to file - we handle all submissions and communications with Polish authorities on your behalf. Most of our clients never visit Poland during the confirmation process.',
      q8: 'What happens during the government phase?',
      a8: 'After we submit your complete application, the provincial governor\'s office (voivodeship) reviews all documents, verifies the citizenship chain, and may request additional documents or clarifications. They conduct their own research in Polish archives and coordinate with other Polish government offices. During this phase, we monitor progress, respond to any inquiries, and keep you updated on the status.',
      q9: 'Can the process be expedited?',
      a9: 'Unfortunately, there is no legal mechanism to expedite government processing times in Poland. Anyone promising fast-track processing is being dishonest. The timeline depends on the complexity of your case, the efficiency of the specific voivodeship handling your application, and current government backlogs. What we can expedite is the preparation phase - gathering documents, conducting research, and preparing your legal brief.',
      q10: 'What happens after a positive decision?',
      a10: 'Once you receive confirmation of Polish citizenship, you can apply for a Polish passport and national ID card (dowód osobisty). The passport application is straightforward and typically takes 1-3 months. You can apply at any Polish consulate or, in some cases, we can assist with applications filed in Poland. With your Polish passport, you have full EU citizenship rights.',
